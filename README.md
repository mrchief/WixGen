= WixGen

[Wix toolkit](http://wix.sourceforge.net/) is awesome!
Authoring a .wxs file by hand - tedious!

It is Xml and thus verbose by nature. 
Moreover, the first time learning is challenging and fun.
Once you know the innards of it, it becomes quite boring.

Many times, you just want to point to a folder, specify few basic settings and wave a magic wand - and wish a .wxs file to be created!

Well WixGen attempts to be the magic wand in the process. 
Before you get greedy with the newly acquired power, you must remember that is just a limited edition for now! 

Other than generating a basic .wxs file, it doesn't offer much. 
This fulfills my basic needs for most cases (i.e. point-n-click wxs generation). 

If you like the idea, then I welcome you to enhance this by adding more capabilities (such as supporting a desktop app?)!

P.S.

* If you're new to Wix, check out Gábor DEÁK JAHN, Tramontána has an excellent tutorial [here](http://wix.tramontana.co.hu/).

* Before creating this project, I stumbled upon [Wix Generator](http://wixgen.codeplex.com/) and [wixgen](http://code.google.com/p/wixgen/); both of which seem inactive or not meeting upto my expectations.
