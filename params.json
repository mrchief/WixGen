{"name":"Wixgen","body":"#WixGen\r\n\r\n[Wix toolkit](http://wix.sourceforge.net/) is awesome!\r\nAuthoring a `.wxs` file by hand - tedious!\r\n\r\nIt is Xml and thus verbose by nature. \r\nMoreover, the first time learning is challenging and fun.\r\nOnce you know the innards of it, it becomes quite boring.\r\n\r\nMany times, you just want to point to a folder, specify few basic settings and wave a magic wand - and wish a `.wxs` file to be created!\r\n\r\nWell WixGen attempts to be the magic wand in the process. \r\nBefore you get greedy with the newly acquired power, you must remember that is just a limited edition for now! \r\n\r\nOther than generating a basic `.wxs` file, it doesn't offer much. \r\nThis fulfills my basic needs for most cases (i.e. point-n-click wxs generation). \r\n\r\nIf you like the idea, then I welcome you to enhance this by adding more capabilities (such as supporting a desktop app?)! \r\nFeel free to fork and send a pull request. \r\nOr send me a PM to become a contributor!\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\n\r\n* If you're new to Wix, Gábor DEÁK JAHN Tramontána has an excellent tutorial [here](http://wix.tramontana.co.hu/).\r\n\r\n* Before creating this project, I stumbled upon [Wix Generator](http://wixgen.codeplex.com/) and [wixgen](http://code.google.com/p/wixgen/); both of which seem inactive or not meeting upto my expectations.
